# The worlds in general
The online game mode is not yet available.
Offline gameplay is still under development.

## Ways to play
In Minecraft-in-python there are two ways to play the game, online
and offline.

1) Online: You can play with anyone who is connected to the network and who,
of course, has Minecraft-in-python installed.

2) Offline: You can play Minecraft-in-python alone.

Personal note from **@ismaelxyz**: What I like about the offline game mode is
that I can  create things and see the results of my own effort and learning.

## The worlds
At the moment Minecraft-in-python only provides one type of world (in theory
we could provide more).
Worlds are the places where you will create things
and do whatever activities you want. No rules, no laws, no limits. You dictate

The intention of the world is to be:

- Round: It starts where it ends and ends where it starts.
- Random: Theoretically no two worlds will ever be the same, when initiated.
- Multiplayer: It has several blocks before reaching the base stone.
