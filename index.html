<p>This is the offical documentation of Minecraft in Python.</p>
<p>Minecraft in Python, abbreviation <code>mcpy</code>, is a Minecraft-like game, it's written in 100% pure python.</p>
<p>Not today, not tomorrow, this game will never be finished. Today we celebrate our first alpha release,
the start of a long list of new alpha releases has begun with Minecraft alpha-0.3.1.
It's to be expected that a video game like this always eager authors who want their creation to be up to date,
usable, bug-free, adapted to multiple platforms (Linux, Mac, Android-Termux, Windows, Windows
and if possible others), extensible, editable (under the guidelines of the GNU GPL3), ready to be
for those who are learning to program, accessible in many aspects. Decided to give up the idea of creating
an application and then leave it or just maintain it.</p>
<p>Minecraft-in-python will be up to date to offer fun, safe, reliable, pytonic and enjoyable
hours of gameplay for anyone who wants not an alternative to Minecraft (Mojang's Minecraft), not another
Minecraft, not another game, not a game created by amateurs, not a superior game.
What we offer you is a dream, the dream of seeing an open-source game written in Python with
simple rules for users to adapt easily, extensible so that you can add features that its authors
couldn't even imagine (too hard, you couldn't do such a thing, we have the imagination
to give away to a bottomless/infinite hole), based on middle age fantacy tales,  for people of 10+ years,
adaptable to the user's computer, multiplatform, multiplayer, with support for different languages, you
know internally modifiable and open in its development for those who want to support it. That's all, almost
nothing, we would like to offer you more but... You decide what you want to play today.</p>
<h1 id="license">License</h1>
<p>Currently and as of 2020/08/07, Minecraft in Python has a license under the
GNU General Public License 3 (GNU GPL3), for the moment we don't want to change license but we don't rule out
a change to a different license, in case the community creates a specific one for the game.</p>
<p>The "dependencies" that are distributed together with mcpy (all of them free software)
have their own "LICENSE" file inserted in the root folder of the dependency where you can read the license
information clearly.</p>

procedures as discreetly as possible in <em>private</em>, in order to be conducive to the resolution of your possible

</ul>
<h2 id="versions">Versions</h2>
<p>For now mcpy has broken and temporarily (at least until its first stable release) will continue to break
compatibility between versions.</p>
<p>to better understand the version system you just have to know that each version has three digits
separated by two points the first digit corresponds to the higher version an increase in said number
would correspond to large, very notable changes in the Video Game especially in the internal part (
the code, its structure, etc).
The second digit corresponds to the minor version there should be one or more increases of this
number each year, its importance (especially with the first stable version) lies in changes
such as the elimination of bugs, the optimization of the code, the addition of one or some new features
to the game that do not interfere with the previous ones and above all not too many. The last digit, the patch
version is only linked to the elimination of small bugs and code optimizations,
changes that have little effect on the playability.</p>
<p>Each version comprises two states alpha and stable, before a version can be stable
it has to go through some tests in its alpha state and later it will be accepted
as a stable version.</p>
